      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This course considers the basic and detailed concepts that go into
        building software to implement user interfaces (UIs). It considers
        factors of input, output, application interface, and related
        infrastructure as well as the typical patterns used to implement them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It considers how these aspects are organized and managed within a
        well-structured object oriented system. We will cover a variety of
        "front-end" programming contexts, including conventional graphical user
        interface (GUI) programming for mobile apps (phones, watches and other
        wearables), web apps, and regular desktop applications, across a variety
        of programming languages and frameworks. We will also cover programming
        for data-driven and conversational (AI) user interfaces (including
        speech and "chat bots"). We will briefly touch on front-end programming
        for visualizations, games, 3D, and virtual and artificial reality (VR
        and AR), along with interactive UI tools such as GUI builders,
        prototypers, and resource editors. The homeworks and project in this
        course will involve extensive object-oriented programming, likely in
        <em>both</em> Java and JavaScript, so this course is only appropriate
        for students with a strong programming background.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that this is <em>not</em> an HCI <em>methods</em> course -- we do
        <em>not</em> cover user-centered design or evaluation methods. This
        course is designed for students in the SCS HCI undergrad Major, but it
        also available to BHCI second majors or HCI minors, Masters of HCI and
        METALS students, or any undergrad or graduate students with an interest
        in the topic and solid prior programming experience, who wish to
        understand the structures needed for professional development of
        interactive systems. Note that <em>all</em> students who register for
        this class will initially be placed on a waitlist. Your position on the
        waitlist is not an indication of whether you will be accepted into the
        class. Priority for getting into the class are students in the HCII
        programs (more senior students first), and then others. The graduate
        (05-631) and undergraduate (05-431) numbers are for the same course with
        the same work.

      <h2>Prerequisite Knowledge</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Students must be strong programmers.</strong> For example,
        having taken 17-214 or 17-514 or 17-437 or 15-214 or 15-213 or 18-213 or
        15-513 or 14-513 or equivalent. 15-1xx level courses will
        <em>not</em> be sufficient. Familiarity with object-oriented programming
        is strongly recommended. Some basic programming experience in both Java
        and Javascript is recommended since homeworks will be in both languages.
        Introductory courses or background in HCI is recommended but not
        required (note that this is <em>not</em> an HCI methods course, so
        students are expected to learn HCI methods elsewhere).
      </p>

      <h2>Course Relevance</h2>
      <p>
        Most software developers will be involved in programming the front-end
        of applications, and there are standard software structures that pervade
        all of the tools that are used to support this.
      </p>

      <h2>Course Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Students will learn the software structures that have stood the test of
        time, and are the foundation of user interface frameworks and libraries
        for various platforms, as well as newer structures for programming the
        user interfaces for AI, data-driven, game and AR/VR systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Assessment Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The course is likely to have multiple programming assignments as the
        homeworks, a final project, a midterm, and possibly also a final exam.
        Some homeworks will require programming in Java, and other homeworks
        will likely involve programming in JavaScript, so the students will be
        expected to know or learn both.
      </p>
      <h2>Learning Resources</h2>
      <p>
        Students will use a variety of learning resources including
        documentation for existing user interface frameworks and tools, along
        with academic research articles (which are all accessible free on-line
        via University library resources).
      </p>
      <h2>Extra Time Commitments</h2>
      <p>
        Assignments, readings and the project for this course are done outside
        of class, but should fit within typical expectations based on the number
        of units of credit.
